### Experience and technical difficulties

This is my first time working with angular, and it took a lot more time to figure out than I expected.
That as well as working with the main project meant that I used a lot of time to understand how to use the REST API. 
The result is that used more time (hence the late delivery), and I still did not end up completing the lab. But at this
point I need to focus on the project instead of this lab. And I'll use the time in the project to understand React, which I am more
interested in.
