### Questions:

The database information I think lies in:

```
<property name="hibernate.dialect" value="org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect"/>
<property name="hibernate.connection.driver_class" value="org.h2.Driver"/>
<property name="hibernate.connection.url" value="jdbc:h2:file:./DB;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1"/>
```
However, I am not sure how to understand that information.

The SQL used to create the table Customer:

```
Hibernate:
create table Customer (
id bigint generated by default as identity,
name varchar(255),
primary key (id)
)
```

I did not find a way to inspect the SQL database.

The assignment went pretty smoothly, however I had some problems when I created the classes for the banking example,
where I used some time to make the tests pass, because I had some differences in the names used for getters and setters.
I tried to use the lombok @getter and @setter, and then the names had to be correct. I also used lists instead of sets
for the relationships, which had to be changed, because the tests expected sets.
